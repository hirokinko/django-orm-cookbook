"When we execute the command :code:`python manage.py test`, a new db is "

"But when we have many migrations, it takes a long time to recreate the "
"database between the test runs. To avoid such situations, we may reuse "
"the old database."

"You can prevent the test databases from being destroyed by adding the "
":code:`--keepdb` flag to the test command. This will preserve the test "
"database between runs. If the database does not exist, it will first be "
"created. If any migrations have been added since the last test run, they "
"will be applied in order to keep it up to date."
