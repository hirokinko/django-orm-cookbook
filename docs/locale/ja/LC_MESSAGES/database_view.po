"A database view is a searchable object in a database that is defined by a"
" query.  Though a view doesn’t store data, some refer to a views as "
"“virtual tables,” you can query a view like you can a table.  A view can "
"combine data from two or more table, using joins, and also just contain a"
" subset of information.  This makes them convenient to abstract, or hide,"
" complicated queries."
